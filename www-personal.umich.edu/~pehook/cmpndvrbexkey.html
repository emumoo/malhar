<p>

&nbsp;la. The compound form &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng"> b:&#242;Y
j:aEy:&#240; </font> gives a more peremptory tone to a command addressed
to a stranger. <br>

&nbsp;lb. The non-compound form &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">
b:&#242;eYy:&#240; </font> is more appropriate for an older relative who
is perfectly willing to co-operate. <p>

&nbsp;2a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l: g:y:&#240;</font>, since the
effect of the action on the victims is exhaustive. (They have died as a
result of the fire.) <br>

&nbsp;2b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l:a </font> because the
action of the fire on the speaker is presented (&nbsp;by the use of
&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">es:f&#252;</font> . . .&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">
j:l:a</font>&nbsp;) as limited in scope. <p>

(from here on the key is still under revision) <p>

<!---

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:`a </font> . The speaker is inviting the addressee to read
in the Ramayana rather than through it. 3b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:` el:y:a </font>. Here note that V - &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> n:&#240; s:&#240; p:hl:&#240; </font> and &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#220;ra </font> are promoting the compound
form. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4a: &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri h&#216;I </font> would be
normal unless the speaker was waiting to be robbed. 4b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri ha&#240; g:I </font> agrees with the
irony of &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> . <p> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> kXa el:y:&#240; </font> with &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> suggests a prior period of resistance. 5b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> kXaO </font> subsumes the haircut
under the larger act of barbering which was rounded off with a shampoo.
<p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> Ap:n:&#240; p:as: rK: l:a&#240; </font> suggests
forethought and anticipation of accidents. 6b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">rK:a&#240; </font> is appropriate to action without visible
effect ( cf. &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#224;Tv:i c:a&#248;d
ka&#240; Ap:n:i Aa&#240;r K:i&#248;c:t:i h&#242; .</font> ) . <p> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">p:k_a </font> is better, especially if grabbing the hand is
seen as subsidiary part of the act of walking together. 7b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:k_ el:y:a </font> brings out the anticipation of
escape and the fear of getting caught. <p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 8a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:aAa&#240;
</font> because eating the candy is presented as good in itself. 8b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:a l:a&#240; </font> here because
eating the candy is seen as a means to some ends. <p>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng">
edK:aI d&#240; g:y:&#240;  </font> , especially if the kite spots him in
spite of the rabbit's efforts to stay out of sight. 9b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> edK:aI di&#248; </font> , since the flames are in
plain sight of the former house-owners. <p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 10a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240;t:i
h&#242; </font>. The speaker is taking pleasure in the fact itself. 10b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240; d&#240;t:i h&#242; </font> ,
in contrast, suggests the speaker's feelings of frustration. <p>

--->

&nbsp;13a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">ha&#240; g:y:a</font>, since
the prior clause indicates that the speaker (and hearer) had been
expecting what happened to happen.  See <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s short story <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, second page, line 16. <p>

&nbsp;13b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">h&#216;Aa </font> because the
presence of &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">hi</font>&nbsp; as a
delimiting particle (incorporated in &nbsp;<FONT
FACE="Xdvng">v:hi</font>&nbsp;) tends to suppress the use of a
compound verb, even when other factors (such as the expression of
fear) favor it. See <FONT FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s
short story <FONT FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, first
line of first page.  <p>
