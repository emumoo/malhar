<center> इससे पहले कि हमें देख लेते ... <br> &nbsp; Anterior clauses, compound verbs, and mood. </center> <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Clauses introduced by  इससे पहले कि ... are used to express actions and events that are preceded or prevented 
by a prior action or event expressed in the main clause.  In (1) for example the event of someone getting angry 
is preceded in time by the speaker's leaving the scene: <p>

1. इससे पहले कि उसे क्रोध आता, हम जल्दी से खसक लिए। &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [2290dee.blogspot.com] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 'We lit out of there before he got angry.'  <p>

In (2) the action of the waves is prevented altogether by a boy's intervention: <p>

2. इससे पहले कि गेंद सामने से आती लहर की लपट में चली जाती, उसने टखने-टखने पानी में जाकर उसे पकड़ लिया। 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [मवाली by मोहन राकेश] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Before an incoming wave could carry the ball away he ran into the shallow water and caught it. <p>

While not obligatory, the subjunctive is the mood of choice in the  इससे पहले कि ... clause.  
Examples (1) and (2) have the past subjunctive; example (3) has the non-past: <p> 

<!-- 4 . इससे पहले कि ... <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;इससे पहले कि वे वहाँ  पहुँचते, गेट को बंद कर दिया गया । 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [navbharattimes.indiatimes.com] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'By the time they got there the gate had already been closed.' <p>

3.  V-ने से पहले (ही) ... <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;उनके पहुँचने से पहले ही पुलिस वालों ने पुलिस लाइन का गेट बंद कर दिया । 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [www.rafatprimenews.in] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'By the time they arrived police had already closed the police line gate.' <p>


Notice that in each of these examples there is a clause containing an action whose time of occurrence precedes 
the time of occurrence of the action in the other clause

While the इससे पहले कि ... construction can be used to express futility as in  (7) it can also be used to express 
an action that another action prevents from occurring (8):  <p>



Hindi-Urdu has at least four ways to mark the occurrence of one event as prior in time to another: <p>

1. जब तक … तब तक … <p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;जब तक घर के काम पूरे होते हैं, तब तक अमूमन 10:30 बज जाते हैं ।
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [hindi.televisionpost.com] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Usually by the time homework is done it is already ten thirty.' <p>

2. V-ते V-ते ...  <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;बच्चों को घर पहुँचते-पहुँचते शाम के 7 बज जाते हैं ...
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [www.press-report.in] <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'By the time kids get home it is already seven o'clock pm.' <p>

. In (1) the striking of 10:30 precedes the completion 
of homework; in (2) seven o'clock comes before the kids get home; in (3) and (4) the closing of the gate occurs 
before certain people get there. We may call the clause expressing the prior event the "anterior clause" 
- even though it comes <b>after</b> the clause or infinitive expressing the later or "posterior" event. <br>
      These four constructions share features: They almost always have a compound verb in the anterior clause, 
while the verb in the posterior clause usually has a non-compound verb. However, they differ in how they are used. <br>
The first allows  speakers to distinguish between neutral or non-commital expression of situations 
in which one event simply precedes another (1) and situations in which prior completion of one action renders 
the following action pointless (5) or impossible (6): <p>

5. जब तक हम  काउंटर पर पहुंचते, खाना खत्म हो गया था ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;[hindi.speakingtree.in] <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'By the time we reached the counter, there was no more food!' <p>

6. जब तक लोग उसे बचाते वह नहर में समा चुका था । &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  [www.divyahimachal.com] <br>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'By the time people came to his rescue he had already been swallowed up by (the waters of) the canal.' <p>

<!-- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hindi-Urdu has several constructions
that mark the occurrence of one event as prior in time to another: <p>
